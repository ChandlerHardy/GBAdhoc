/* fe_gbadual.h -- the GBA link mirror's second machine in a frontend
 * (GBA_LINK builds only; docs/GBA-LINK-MIRROR.md).
 *
 * The local machine is the core as the frontend already runs it (instance A,
 * slot 0 here).  This module brings up instance B (the renamed copy of the
 * core) on the same cartridge, starts it from the same save state, and steps
 * the two through gbalink_pair with the cable between them.
 *
 * Milestone 3 (this file): the bench form, no network -- the partner's
 * buttons come from the player (mirror) or from a frame-stamped script.  The
 * network session will feed the same pair.
